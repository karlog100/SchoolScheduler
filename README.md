# SchoolScheduler
A Schedule for teachers and students, 
where they can see there's classes and participant.

We use Visual Studio online (VSO) for projectmanagement, with agile "scrum".
Vso require that all participants or spectators is registred through the project and invited.
(Micheal you should have gotten an invite.)
Afterwards can you open the VSO through this link:

And you will get to the project management root backlog site, there you can see every process in the project.
